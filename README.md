# JS-PUB-SUB
Training Material to write and understand the Pub/Sub Pattern

### Instructions
1. checkout the repository
2. navigate to the root of this project in the terminal
3. Either run yarn, or npm i
4. If there are issues downlloading the dependencies, you may need to comment out your ~/.npmrc file which sits on user root.
5. either run `yarn start` or `npm run start`
6. Optionally, if you want to yarn install it globally (`npm install -g yarn`);
7. You should see the project up and running in localhost:1234
8. Use chrome, as I have not tested in other browsers
