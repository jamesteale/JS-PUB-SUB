# JS-PUB-SUB
Training Material to write and understand the Pub/Sub Pattern

### Instructions
1. checkout the repository
2. navigate to the root of this project in the terminal
3. Either run yarn, or npm i
4. If there are issues downlloading the dependencies, you may need to comment out your ~/.npmrc file which sits on user root.
5. either run `yarn start` or `npm run start`
6. Optionally, if you want to yarn install it globally (`npm install -g yarn`);
7. You should see the project up and running in localhost:1234
8. Use chrome, as I have not tested in other browsers

## Goals of the session
Implement the pub/sub pattern

#### Stretch Goals
1. Add new button to set the monster aand coffee cup back to its default state.
2. Use a composition pattern instead of inheritence.

#### Take Away Goals
1. Relook the composition implementation which does not use a mixin. Maybe a HOC, withSubscription component maybe.
2. Any of the stretch goals we did not get too.

### Agenda

* Pattern Design (White board)
